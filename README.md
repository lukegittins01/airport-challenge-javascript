Approach to learning a new language
-----------------------------------

- Get to grips with basic concepts of new language i.e variables, printing, arrays, loops, if conditional statements.

- I learned how to make methods and objects.

- Write a simple programme that use some of these concepts i.e FizzBuzz.

- I then learned how to get user input.

- Then for other challenges set to me i would research online for whatever came up. i.e if there was something i was unsure about i would just look it up when i come across it.

- Moving forward i will continue to research when something i don't understand appears or something i don't know how to achieve crops up.

- I have also noticed that i don't learn it fully the first time i may have to go over it more than once before i understand it.
